# Simple Node Server
Question 2 for the codefellows javascript coding challenge.

To start run `node server.js`. To perform linting tasks run `grunt`.

`server.js` is a simple node server that points to a root file named `index.html`. It reads its configuration from a file named `config.json`, and also watches that file for changes.


Prompt:

```
Create a simple http server using node. This server should respond to a root-url request with 
a file called index.html. Do not use ExpressJS. Your code should have error checking and at 
least one callback. Put five or more html elements in your index.html. 
One of the elements should be a link to an external page. 
Things to research: node.js, callbacks, the fs module, the http module.
